Welcome to elastix: a toolbox for rigid and nonrigid registration of images.

elastix is open source software, based on the well-known [Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK)](https://itk.org/). The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to perform (medical) image registration: the task of finding a spatial transformation, mapping one image (the _fixed_ image) to another (the _moving_ image), by optimizing relevant image similarity metrics. The modular design of elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration methods for a specific application. A command-line interface enables automated processing of large numbers of data sets, by means of scripting.
Nowadays elastix is accompanied by [ITKElastix](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKElastix) making it available in Python ([on Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/itk-elastix/)) and by [SimpleElastix](http://simpleelastix.github.io/), making it available in languages like C++, Python, Java, R, Ruby, C# and Lua. A docker image of the latest elastix build is available as well on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/superelastix/elastix). Several plugins exist for those who wish to use the functionality of elastix in a graphical user interface, among others a [napari](https://github.com/SuperElastix/elastix_napari) and a [3Dslicer](https://github.com/lassoan/SlicerElastix) plugin.

## Authors ##

The lead developers of elastix are [Stefan Klein](https://github.com/stefanklein) and [Marius Staring](https://github.com/mstaring). This software was initially developed at the [Image Sciences Institute](http://www.isi.uu.nl), under supervision of [Josien P.W. Pluim](http://www.isi.uu.nl/People/Josien/). Today, [many](https://github.com/SuperElastix/elastix/graphs/contributors) have contributed to elastix.

# Master's thesis #

This is a fork of [elastix](https://github.com/SuperElastix/elastix) in which we explore the application of hybrid evolutionary algorithms to deformable image registration for a Master's thesis at the TU Delft. We implement RV-GOMEA in elastix with support for partial evaluations. Additionally, we implement a hybrid local search operator and add specific constraints for the B-spline transformation model. An analytic version of the bending energy when using B-splines is also integrated.

## Building ##
 
 ### Requirements ###
 - [CMake](https://cmake.org/) >=3.16.3
 - CBLAS (e.g. [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS))
 - LAPACK (e.g. [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS))
 - [Boost](https://www.boost.org/)
 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

 Make sure that these dependencies are installed and can be found by CMake, see [this guide](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Finding%20Packages.html) for more information.

 Then the project can be configured and built as follows:
 ```
# Create build directory.
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure the build.
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING={BUILD_TYPE} ../

# Build the project.
cmake --build . 
 ```

We use a superbuild to build all the dependencies not included in the requirements. The superbuild requires a build type (e.g. Debug, Release) to be set during configuration, which can be specified with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING={BUILD_TYPE}`. It is not necessary but advisable to use the Ninja generator for CMake. If installed, it can be specified during the configure step with `-G Ninja`.

 Due to a harcoding of the build directory in `CMake/SuperBuild.cmake`, the build directory has to be in the root of the project and named "build". If a different build directory is desired, you would have to change the hardcoded path in this file. Subdirectories can be used, e.g., build/Release or build/Debug.
